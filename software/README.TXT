This folder contains some Microtronic programs, from Microtronic
Manual Vol. 2 and the book "Computer Games" (2094) The programs have
been retrieved using an OCR program from these PDFs. Frequently, I is
used for 1, or l for 1, O or Q for 0, etc. The Arduino Emulator will
accept those characters. Sometimes, b is really a 6, P might be a D, U
is likely a O, and B might actually be a an 8, and vice versa. If a
program fails to load, please correct with a text editor. I will also
correct those over time. Progams which have been verified / tested
have a # tested comment.
