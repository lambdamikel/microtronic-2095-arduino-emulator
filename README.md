### Abstract

This is an emulator of the Busch 2095 Cassette Interface for the
historical Busch 2090 Microtronic Computer System, implemented on the
Arduino Uno R3. It allows you to save and load Microtronic programs to
/ from an SD card, using an Arduino Uno R3, an SD+Ethernet Card
Shield, and an LCD+Keypad Shield. It connects directly to the Busch
2090 "expansion port", using a simple 14 PIN IC socket and breadboard
cables.

This project owns its existence to [Martin
Sauter's](https://github.com/martinsauter) [Raspberry Pi-based tape
emulator for the Busch 2090 historical
microcomputer](https://github.com/martinsauter/Busch-2090-Projects). 
Martin had the original idea and did the tedious [reverse engineering
of the Busch Microtronic 2095 Cassette 
Interface](https://blog.wirelessmoves.com/2017/06/emulating-a-busch-2090-tape-interface-part-1.html).
Without it, this project would not exist. 

I reimplemented his findings in C for the Arduino, because I prefer a microcontroller-based 
"all in one" solution over the Raspberry Pi, which requires booting Linux etc. 

### Description 

Soon.
